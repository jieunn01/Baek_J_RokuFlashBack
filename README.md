# Roku Flash Back 

### Introduction 

Provide Roku streaming service using comfortable UI&UX. There are two versions of website layouts depending on the age of the users. Parents mode and kids mode show overall different contents, kids mode have limited control to setting other icons. Each thumbnail card will give some information about the video before the user watches it. 

### Goal / design background

Create a practical website design with UX. Prefer to use icons than letters, so the overall design will probably be clear than showing too much letters. For focusing on the posters and making users' eyes comfortable from lots of colors, the background color will be different. When the kids use the app, parents can check quickly becuase the backgournd color will be white.
